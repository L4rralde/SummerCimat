# Notes on VGGT

**Prior knowledge**

- Bundle Adjustment: Check Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision book.
- State-of-the-art Structure from Motion (SfM) methods like [VGGSfM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04563).
- Dust3r (TODO: read).
- Transformers from Attention is all you need.
- DINO:
    - [Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294) (DINO)
    - [DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193)
- DPT: [Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13413) Intel Labs.
- Flash Attention (v3)
